Collection of my exercises in Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Table of Contents
1. [DQN](https://github.com/AyonRabbani/Machine-Learning/blob/master/DQN.ipynb) - Implementation of Deep Q Network that plays OpenAI's cart pole
2. [QLearning](https://github.com/AyonRabbani/Machine-Learning/blob/master/QLearning.ipynb) - Implementation of Q-Learning algorithm that plays OpenAI's Frozen Lake 
3. [Formula1](https://github.com/AyonRabbani/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Formula1-Team-Identification.ipynb) - Using resnet34 and resnet50 to classify cars into their teams
4. [Decision Tree from Scratch](https://github.com/AyonRabbani/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Airbnb_Decision_Tree.ipynb) - Regression decision tree. Used [Jeremy Howard](https://course18.fast.ai/ml.html) and [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) textbook for guidance and inspiration. 
5. [N-grams + Markov Chains to Predict Next Word](https://github.com/AyonRabbani/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Predict_next_word_using_Ngrams.ipynb) - An intuitive algorithm that shows how n-grams can be used to predict the next word. Used [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) textbook released by Stanford professors Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. 
6. [Very Naive Bayesian Sentiment Analysis Algorithm](https://github.com/AyonRabbani/Machine-Learning/blob/master/NaiveBayesExploration.ipynb) - A sentiment analysis algorithm written in python. Used Amazon Reviews dataset to analyze sentiment of words. For example the word 'I' is mostly used with negative reviews. 
7. Dense Multilayer Network - Work in progess.
